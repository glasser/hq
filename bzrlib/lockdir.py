"""On-disk mutex protecting a resource

bzr on-disk objects are locked by the existence of a directory with a
particular name within the control directory.  We use this rather than OS
internal locks (such as flock etc) because they can be seen across all
transports, including http.

Objects can be read if there is only physical read access; therefore 
readers can never be required to create a lock, though they will
check whether a writer is using the lock.  Writers can't detect
whether anyone else is reading from the resource as they write.
This works because of ordering constraints that make sure readers
see a consistent view of existing data.

Waiting for a lock must be done by polling; this can be aborted after
a timeout.

Locks must always be explicitly released, typically from a try/finally
block -- they are not released from a finalizer or when Python
exits.

Locks may fail to be released if the process is abruptly terminated
(machine stop, SIGKILL) or if a remote transport becomes permanently
disconnected.  There is therefore a method to break an existing lock.
This should rarely be used, and generally only with user approval.
Locks contain some information on when the lock was taken and by who
which may guide in deciding whether it can safely be broken.  (This is
similar to the messages displayed by emacs and vim.) Note that if the
lock holder is still alive they will get no notification that the lock
has been broken and will continue their work -- so it is important to be
sure they are actually dead.

A lock is represented on disk by a directory of a particular name,
containing an information file.  Taking a lock is done by renaming a
temporary directory into place.  We use temporary directories because
for all known transports and filesystems we believe that exactly one
attempt to claim the lock will succeed and the others will fail.  (Files
won't do because some filesystems or transports only have
rename-and-overwrite, making it hard to tell who won.)

The desired characteristics are:

* Locks are not reentrant.  (That is, a client that tries to take a 
  lock it already holds may deadlock or fail.)
* Stale locks can be guessed at by a heuristic
* Lost locks can be broken by any client
* Failed lock operations leave little or no mess
* Deadlocks are avoided by having a timeout always in use, clients
  desiring indefinite waits can retry or set a silly big timeout.

Storage formats use the locks, and also need to consider concurrency
issues underneath the lock.  A format may choose not to use a lock
at all for some operations.

LockDirs always operate over a Transport.  The transport may be readonly, in
which case the lock can be queried but not acquired.

Locks are identified by a path name, relative to a base transport.

Calling code will typically want to make sure there is exactly one LockDir
object per actual lock on disk.  This module does nothing to prevent aliasing
and deadlocks will likely occur if the locks are aliased.

In the future we may add a "freshen" method which can be called
by a lock holder to check that their lock has not been broken, and to 
update the timestamp within it.

Example usage:

>>> from bzrlib.transport.memory import MemoryTransport
>>> # typically will be obtained from a BzrDir, Branch, etc
>>> t = MemoryTransport()
>>> l = LockDir(t, 'sample-lock')
>>> l.create()
>>> token = l.wait_lock()
>>> # do something here
>>> l.unlock()

# TODO: We sometimes have the problem that our attempt to rename '1234' to
# 'held' fails because the transport server moves into an existing directory,
# rather than failing the rename.  If we made the info file name the same as
# the locked directory name we would avoid this problem because moving into
# the held directory would implicitly clash.  However this would not mesh with
# the existing locking code and needs a new format of the containing object.
