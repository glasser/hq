Patterns
========

Bazaar uses patterns to match files at various times. For example,
the ``add`` command skips over files that match ignore patterns
and preferences can be associated with files using rule patterns.
The pattern syntax is described below.

Trailing slashes on patterns are ignored. If the pattern contains a
slash or is a regular expression, it is compared to the whole path
from the branch root. Otherwise, it is compared to only the last
component of the path. To match a file only in the root directory,
prepend './'. Patterns specifying absolute paths are not allowed.

Patterns may include globbing wildcards such as::

  ? - Matches any single character except '/'
  * - Matches 0 or more characters except '/'
  /**/ - Matches 0 or more directories in a path
  [a-z] - Matches a single character from within a group of characters

Patterns may also be Python regular expressions. Regular expression
patterns are identified by a 'RE:' prefix followed by the regular
expression.  Regular expression patterns may not include named or
numbered groups.
