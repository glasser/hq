Rules
=====

Introduction
------------

Rules are defined in ini file format where the sections are file glob
patterns and the contents of each section are the preferences for files
matching that pattern. For example::

    [name *.bat]
    eol = dos

    [name *.html]
    keywords = escape

Preferences like these are useful for commands and plugins wishing to
provide custom behaviour for selected files in selected branches.


Files
-----

Default rules for all branches are defined in the optional file
``BZR_HOME/rules``. 

Rule Patterns
-------------

Patterns are ordered and searching stops as soon as one matches.
As a consequence, more explicit patterns should be placed towards
the top of the file. Rule patterns use exactly the same conventions
as ignore patterns. See ``bzr help patterns`` for details.

Note: Patterns containing square brackets should be surrounded in
quotes to ensure they are corrected parsed.
