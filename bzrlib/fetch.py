"""Copying of history from one branch to another.

The basic plan is that every branch knows the history of everything
that has merged into it.  As the first step of a merge, pull, or
branch operation we copy history from the source into the destination
branch.

The copying is done in a slightly complicated order.  We don't want to
add a revision to the store until everything it refers to is also
stored, so that if a revision is present we can totally recreate it.
However, we can't know what files are included in a revision until we
read its inventory.  So we query the inventory store of the source for
the ids we need, and then pull those ids and then return to the inventories.
