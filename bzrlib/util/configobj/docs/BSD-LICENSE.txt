===================================
 The Voidspace Open Source License
===================================

.. note::

    See this document online at http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/license.shtml

This is the OSI_ Approved license that the Voidspace modules and programs are
available under [#]_. It's often reffered to as the *BSD License*.

It is a very unrestrictive license but it comes with the usual disclaimer. 
This is free software: test it, break it, just don't blame me if it eats your 
data ! Of course if it does, let me know and I'll fix the problem so that it 
doesn't happen to anyone else {sm;:-)}.
