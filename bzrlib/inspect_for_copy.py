"""A version of inspect that includes what 'copy' needs.

Importing the python standard module 'copy' is far more expensive than it
needs to be, because copy imports 'inspect' which imports 'tokenize'.
And 'copy' only needs 2 small functions out of 'inspect', but has to
load all of 'tokenize', which makes it horribly slow.

This module is designed to use tricky hacks in import rules, to avoid this
overhead.

# These are the only 2 functions that 'copy' needs from 'inspect'
# As you can see, they are quite trivial, and don't justify the
# 40ms spent to import 'inspect' because it is importing 'tokenize'
# These are copied verbatim from the python standard library.
