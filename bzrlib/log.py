"""Code to show logs of changes.

Various flavors of log can be produced:

* for one file, or the whole tree, and (not done yet) for
  files in a given directory

* in "verbose" mode with a description of what changed from one
  version to the next

* with file-ids and revision-ids shown

Logs are actually written out through an abstract LogFormatter
interface, which allows for different preferred formats.  Plugins can
register formats too.

Logs can be produced in either forward (oldest->newest) or reverse
(newest->oldest) order.

Logs can be filtered to show only revisions matching a particular
search string, or within a particular range of revisions.  The range
can be given as date/times, which are reduced to revisions before
calling in here.

In verbose mode we show a summary of what changed in each particular
revision.  Note that this is the delta for changes in that revision
relative to its left-most parent, not the delta relative to the last
logged revision.  So for example if you ask for a verbose log of
changes touching hello.c you will get a list of those revisions also
listing other things that were changed in the same revision, but not
all the changes since the previous revision that touched hello.c.
