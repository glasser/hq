"""Locking using OS file locks or file existence.

Note: This method of locking is generally deprecated in favour of LockDir, but
is used to lock local WorkingTrees, and by some old formats.  It's accessed
through Transport.lock_read(), etc.

This module causes two methods, lock() and unlock() to be defined in
any way that works on the current platform.

It is not specified whether these locks are reentrant (i.e. can be
taken repeatedly by a single process) or whether they exclude
different threads in a single process.  That reentrancy is provided by
LockableFiles.

This defines two classes: ReadLock and WriteLock, which can be
implemented in different ways on different platforms.  Both have an
unlock() method.
