"""Transport is an abstraction layer to handle file access.

The abstraction is to allow access from the local filesystem, as well
as remote (such as http or sftp).

Transports are constructed from a string, being a URL or (as a degenerate
case) a local filesystem path.  This is typically the top directory of
a bzrdir, repository, or similar object we are interested in working with.
The Transport returned has methods to read, write and manipulate files within
it.
