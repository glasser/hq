Mystery Hunt collaboration site, built for Optimus Funk for Hunt 2009.

Runs on Google App Engine.

Note: Vaguely using Google's Python style, a version of which is at
http://code.google.com/p/soc/wiki/PythonStyleGuide.

Rules I actually care about:

  - no 'from foo import *'

  - no 'from foo import FunctionOrClass' (but importing a submodule is fine)

  - when passing an argument to a function that takes default
    arguments (like "def foo(x, y=2)") always name the argument during
    the call "foo(x, y=3)".  (Of course, you can leave the argument
    out too to use the default.)

  - 2-space indents; no tabs ever.  for line continuations, align
    vertically or use a 4-space indent
