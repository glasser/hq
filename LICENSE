hq is copyright (c) 2009 David Glasser.

The files under bzrlib/ are copyright Bram Cohen and Canonical Ltd
(see individual files for precise copyrights) with minor tweaks from
David Glasser, distributed under the GPLv2+.

my_template.py is mostly copyright Google Inc and Lawrence
Journal-World (see it for precise copyrights) with some changes from
David Glasser.

hq is GPLv2+.  (But mostly because I don't want to think hard about
the use of bzrlib; if somebody really wants this under an
Apache/BSD-style license, I'd be happy to tear out bzrlib and
relicense the resulting software.)
